OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

PROJECT: BMI TRACKER APP

OBJECTIVE
The objective of a BMI Tracker App is to provide users with an easy-to-use platform to monitor their health by calculating and tracking their Body Mass Index (BMI) over time. The app helps users understand their BMI and its relationship to their overall health, encouraging healthier habits and regular monitoring.

Key Objectives:

Calculate BMI:
The primary goal is to help users calculate their BMI based on their height and weight using the standard formula:
BMI
=
weight in kg
(
height in meters
)
2
BMI= 
(height in meters) 
2
 
weight in kg
​
 
The app may also allow for unit flexibility (e.g., pounds/inches).

Track BMI Over Time:
Provide users with the ability to track their BMI history. This feature helps users visualize their progress and identify trends, such as weight gain, weight loss, or maintenance.

Categorize Health Status:
Based on the calculated BMI, categorize users into health status categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
Inform users about their classification to raise awareness of potential health risks associated with their BMI category.

Encourage Healthy Habits:
Provide actionable tips and suggestions for maintaining or improving BMI, such as exercise routines, dietary advice, or goal-setting features.

Notifications and Reminders:
Remind users to regularly log their weight and height, encouraging consistent tracking and engagement with the app.

Visualization:
Offer clear and visually appealing charts or graphs to track BMI over time, making it easier for users to understand trends and changes in their health data.

Promote Health Awareness:
Educate users about the importance of BMI in relation to overall health, and provide information about how BMI correlates with risks of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related conditions.


Allow users to set personal goals, such as reaching a specific BMI target or maintaining their current BMI.
